answer for question 2:The error plot for RK4 may increase when the time-step size is very small because of the accumulation of round-off errors. As the time-step size decreases, the number of time-steps required to integrate the system increases, leading to a greater number of arithmetic operations and an increased chance of round-off errors. These errors accumulate over time, leading to an overall increase in the error of the solution. Additionally, using small time-steps may cause the solution to be computationally expensive. This can cause the error from the numerical integration method to be dominated by the error from the floating-point arithmetic used to perform the calculations.
